# README for "wxretrieval" utility

## General

This directory contains a Python 3 module to retrieve forecast data from
publicly available sources for use with Met.3D. Currently, data from the
"opendata" server from the German Weather Service (DWD) is supported.


## Configuration

To use the scripts, you need to copy the configuration file template
"wxlib/config.py.template" to "wxlib/config.py". Then adjust it to your
needs.

An example use of the module is given in the file "retrieve_dwd_example.py".
